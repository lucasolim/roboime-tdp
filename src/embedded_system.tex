\section{Embedded System}\label{emb_sys_sec}
RoboIME electronics consist of seven boards: (a) the Main board, responsible for communication between the other boards; (b) the Stamp board, responsible for the embedded computations; (c) the Kicker board, responsible for maintaining high voltage to activate the kickers; (d) four motor controller boards which are responsible for the robot's motion control. These boards are described in details in this section.

\subsection{Main Board}
The Main Board features a socket to plug the boards in: the kicker's sensor, dribbler motor, four wheels' motors, four encoders and the power supply. There is a RFM12b SMD embedded, which is a wireless transceiver operating in the 434 MHz band, set up for 115.2 kbps, fully compliant with FCC and ETSI regulations.

The communication protocol used between the Stamp Board and the transceiver is a Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI), a synchronous serial data link standard that operates in full duplex mode.

\subsection{Stamp Board}
This board is responsible  for performing all the logical functions. Serving as a brain of sorts for the electronic system. There is an embedded STM32F407 micro-controller, with an ARM Cortex M4 as main CPU, 1 MB Flash, 192 KB RAM memory, working at 168 MHz, that was programmed in C language using CoIDE and Eclipse IDEs.

\subsection{Kicker Board}
This board is responsible for controlling the kick strength. There are two kinds of kick, the forward kick and the high kick. Two capacitors of 2200 $\mu$F, 200 V are used to store the voltage in a boost circuit. The charge is discharged in a solenoid and depending on the PWM signal one of the kicker devices is activated, controlling the kick velocity.

\subsection{Motor Controller Board}
The idea of the RoboIME electronic is to modularize the electronic project. So, there is one controller module board for each wheel motor. If one of them burns out, it is possible to exchange it quickly. Each board has two TC4427 (MOSFET driver) and two IRF7319 (half H bridge). These ICs create an H-bridge, allowing for velocity control in both directions.
