\section{Embedded System}\label{emb_sys_sec}
RoboIME electronics consist of seven boards: (a) the Main board, responsible for communication between the other boards; (b) the Stamp board,
responsible  for the embedded computation; (c) the Kicker board, responsible for maintaining high voltage to activate the kick shoot;
(d) four motor controller board which are responsible for robot's motion control. These boards are described in details in this section.

\subsection{Main Board}
The Main Board features a socket to plugin the boards: kick's sensor, dribble's motor, four wheel's motor, four encoders and the power supply.
There is a RFM12b SMD embedded which is a wireless transceiver operating in the 434 MHz band, set as up to 115.2 kbps, fully in agreement
with FCC and ETSI regulations.

The communication protocol used between the Stamp Board and the transceiver is the Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI), which is a synchronous
serial data link standard that operates in full duplex mode.

\subsection{Stamp Board}
This board is responsible  for performing all the logic functions. It is like a brain of the electronic system. There is an embedded micro-controller STM32F407,
with ARM Cortex M4 as main CPU, 1 MB Flash, 192 KB RAM memory, working in 168 MHz, that was programmed with C language using the  interface development
CoIDE and Eclipse IDE.

\subsection{Kicker Board}
This board is responsible for controlling the kick strength. There are two kinds of kick,
the kick shoot and the high kick. Two capacitors of 2200 $\mu$F, 200 V are used to store the
voltage in a boost circuit. The charge is discharged in a solenoid and depending on the PWM
signal the kick device is activated, it is possible to control the kick velocity.

\subsection{Motor Controller Board}
The idea of the RoboIME electronic is to modularize the electronic project. So, there
is controller module board for each wheel's motor. If one of them burns out, it is
possible to exchange it quickly. Each board has two TC4427 (MOSFET driver) and two
IRF7319 (half H bridge). These ICs create a H-bridge, allowing velocity control in
both directions.
